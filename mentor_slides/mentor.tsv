At Olin, I was more on the EE side of things, and went through a mostly EE/CE PhD program (focused on formal verification of clockless circuits, with Rajit Manohar, then at Cornell, now at Yale). I like academia, but am now very firmly in industry. Can share things about research, academia, and industry.	Music (bass guitar, piano, livecoding), gaming, video game emulation	Midnight riders, theater, research, Ninja'ing. 	Work, and music. Been learning piano for the past few years.	In grad school, worked with some people in the CS department to define two separate programming-language like semantics for a class of circuits, one where it was easier to prove that the language matched the circuit, and one where it was easier to write higher-level proofs, and then used the Coq theorem prover to show they were equivalent (Preventing Glitches and Short Circuits in High-Level Self-Timed Chip Specifications). This worked out to a formally-proven program that built proofs in one domain and then transformed proofs into proofs in the other domain, while generating a proof that the transformation was correct.

I chose to work for small companies and startups before attempting to do contract engineering design work right out of college.
